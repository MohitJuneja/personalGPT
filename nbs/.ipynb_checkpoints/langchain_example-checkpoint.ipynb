You'll hear back from a short like kind of on the unified support stuff and then once we kind of get that laid out, we can talk more about how to. You know, do more from a helping you with the evaluation of of power platform because that's where you know my side of the equation comes back into play is is helping you understand, you know you're kind of focused right now on governance which is great. But you know part of my longer term job is to make sure you're fully aware of the platform, how you can use it, what are good use cases etcetera, etcetera.
